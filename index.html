        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          I am Surhud Naik and i just completed my first year in Btech.
          Mechanical Engineering at IIT Bombay. It was not more than a year ago
          that I joined this institute, but it feels like I have been here for a
          long time. The first year at IIT Bombay was a enriching to say the
          least and was certainly a year to remember. I made a lot of new
          friends, learned a lot of new things, and had a lot of fun. I am from
          Mumbai itself so there was less of a culture shock for me, as it was
          for many of my to-be friends who had come from lesser known villages
          and towns across the country. The first year was a time of
          exploration, where I got to know the campus, the people, and the
          culture of IIT Bombay.

        <h1>Activities</h1>
        <p>
          I was an active participant in various activities and events, most
          notable of which are those which were conducted by Symphony, the Music
          Club of IIT Bombay. I participated in the annual IITB band
          competition, Battle of the Bands, where I formed a band with other
          musically gifted students of my batch and played a medley of 3 songs.
          I also performed as a drummer in Surbahaar, the annual Musical
          Showcase where I was a part of the Garaj Garaj Rock band along with
          other senior members of Symphony.
          <br />
          DevCom was one of the few clubs that caught my attention since the
          start, and I went on to develop an interest in web development. I
          learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and created a few projects in the
          course of the recruitment process for DevCom. I was finally selected
          after 3 months of the rigorous recruitment process, and I am now a
          member of the DevCom team as a developer.
          <br />
          I also volunteered as an organiser for TechFest, the annual technical
          festival of IIT Bombay, where I helped in organising Robowars and
          controlling the console during the main event for the three days of
          the festival. Since all my friends from mumbai since the JEE days also
          had holidays and were home, we were able to ennjoy Mood Indigo
          together.
          <br />
          I got the rare chance of being a part of Goonj, the annual music
          hostel GC, where I represented Hostel 17 as a drummer and composed a
          song together with them. It was a great experience to work with Mtech
          students of the campus and get exposed to their wide wisdom and
          experience.

        <h1>Learnings</h1>
        <p>
          The first year at IIT Bombay was a time of learning and growth. I
          learned a lot about myself, my interests, and my passions. I learned
          how to manage my time effectively, how to work in a team, and how to
          balance academics with extracurricular activities.
          <br />
          IIT Bombay exposed me to a lot of new ideas and perspectives, and I
          learned to think critically and creatively. I also learned the
          importance of networking and building relationships with people from
          different backgrounds and cultures. I learnt to live independently,
          managing my own finances, and taking care of my own laundry.
          <br />
          I was allotted H1, which as everyone on campus knows, is an
          adjustement to live in, but I saw it turn into a new home away from
          home. In the end, the core lesson I learnt was that of getting by in
          life when you are your own support system owning up to yourself and
          your actions, and being responsible for your own decisions.
